# LEGO Island modern Installer
> An Moderm installer for the 1997 video game **LEGO Island**




I am bringing this alternative installer for LEGO Island back to life in order to keep it alive. In the medium term, I aim to make it install MODern LEGO Island ( https://olivatryd.itch.io/modern-lego-island ), allowing installation from the original ISO and enabling it to run directly on modern computers.

1.3 Version
- I update some code and new minium OS: windows 10.
- New image 

## Original

This is based on https://github.com/le717/Island-Alternate-Installer, I am continuing the already archived project.


## Old Features

* Acts as a full replacement for the original 16-bit InstallShield installer
* Improves game compatibility on modern versions of Windows by updating outdated APIs
	+ Uses the latest released version of d3drm.dll from 2001 over the 1997 version that was bundled with the disc
	+ Replaces the stock version of ddraw.dll with one from the [DDrawCompat wrapper project](https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat "DDrawCompat")
* Includes an optional no CD-ROM patch
* Enables installation of the Japanese version, whose original installer was locked to Windows 9x
